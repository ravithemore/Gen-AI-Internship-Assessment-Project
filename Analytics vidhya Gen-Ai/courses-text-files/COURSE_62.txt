Course description :
Learn all about the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Algorithm in Machine Learning
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. As a newcomer or beginner in machine learning, you’ll find KNN to be among the easiest algorithms to pick up.
And despite its simplicity, KNN has proven to be incredibly effective at certain tasks in machine learning.
The KNN algorithm is simple to understand, easy to explain and perfect to demonstrate to a non-technical audience (that’s why stakeholders love it!). That’s a key reason why it’s widely used in the industry and why you should know how the algorithm works.

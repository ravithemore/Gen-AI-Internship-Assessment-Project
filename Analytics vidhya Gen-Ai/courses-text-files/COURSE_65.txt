Course description :
Learning Naive Bayes from Scratch for Machine Learning
Naive Bayes ranks in the top echelons of the machine learning algorithms pantheon. It is a popular and widely used machine learning algorithm and is often the go-to technique when dealing with classification problems.
The beauty of Naive Bayes lies in it’s incredible speed. You’ll soon see how fast the Naive Bayes algorithm works as compared to other classification algorithms. It works on the Bayes theorem of probability to predict the class of unknown datasets. You’ll learn all about this inside the course!
So whether you’re trying to solve a classic HR analytics problem like predicting who gets promoted, or you’re aiming to predict loan default - the Naive Bayes algorithm will get you on your way.

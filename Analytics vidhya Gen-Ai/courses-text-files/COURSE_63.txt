Course description :
A Comprehensive Course on Ensemble Learning
Ensemble learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is used across industries by data science experts. The beauty of ensemble learning techniques is that they combine the predictions of multiple machine learning models.
You must have used or come across several of these ensemble learning techniques in your machine learning journey:
- Bagging
- Boosting
- Stacking
- Blending, etc.
These ensemble learning techniques include popular machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, among others. You must be getting a good idea of how vast and useful ensemble learning can be!

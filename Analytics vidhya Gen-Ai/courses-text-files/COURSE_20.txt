Course title : Building Your first RAG System using LlamaIndex - Free Course.\

Title description : Dive into the sea of Retrieval Augmented Generation with this free course that will help you build your first RAG model with the popular LlamaIndex.

Course description : This course will guide you through building your first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LlamaIndex. You will start with data ingestion by loading a file into the system, followed by indexing the data for efficient retrieval. Next, you will set up retrieval configurations and use a response synthesizer to combine data into a coherent response. Finally, you will employ a query engine to generate responses. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of these processes and be able to build an RAG system using LlamaIndex code effectively.

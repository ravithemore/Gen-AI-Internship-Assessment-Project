Course description : This is a very common question interviewers ask in data science interviews. We have conducted hundreds of these interviews for both data analyst and data scientist roles and this is quite often the jackpot question. This is especially true if you’re a fresher or a relative newcomer to data science. Just doing courses or attaining certifications isn’t good enough. Almost everyone we know holds certifications in various aspects of data science. It adds no value to your resume if you don’t combine it with practical experience. And that’s where open-source data science projects play such a key role!

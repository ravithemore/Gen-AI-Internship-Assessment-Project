Course description :
Learn All About sklearn - The Powerful Python Library for Machine Learning
Scikit-learn, or sklearn for short, is the first Python library we turn to when building machine learning models. Sklearn is unanimously the favorite Python library among data scientists. As a newcomer to machine learning, you should be comfortable with sklearn and how to build ML models, including:
Linear Regression using sklearn
Logistic Regression using sklearn, and so on.
 Thereâ€™s no question - scikit-learn provides handy tools with easy-to-read syntax. Among the pantheon of popular Python libraries, scikit-learn (sklearn) ranks in the top echelon along with Pandas and NumPy.
We love the clean, uniform code and functions that scikit-learn provides. The excellent documentation is the icing on the cake as it makes a lot of beginners self-sufficient with building machine learning models using sklearn.
In short, sklearn is a must-know Python library for machine learning. Whether you want to build linear regression or logistic regression models, decision tree or a random forest, sklearn is your go-to library.
